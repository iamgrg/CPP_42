# CPP Module 09 - STL

## Project Overview

CPP Module 09 explores the practical application of the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++, focusing on using STL containers, iterators, and algorithms to solve complex problems efficiently. This module emphasizes the adaptability and power of the STL to handle data dynamically and perform operations like sorting and searching with ease.

## Description

This module consists of exercises that challenge students to implement solutions using various STL components. Each exercise is designed to build proficiency in using different aspects of the STL, including containers for data storage, algorithms for data processing, and iterators for data traversal.

## Key Features

- **Bitcoin Exchange**: Implements a program that uses STL containers to manage historical bitcoin price data and calculate the value of bitcoin on specific dates.
- **Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)**: Develops a calculator for evaluating expressions in reverse Polish notation using STL stacks.
- **PmergeMe**: A sorting algorithm that combines merge sort and insertion sort to efficiently sort large datasets, utilizing multiple STL containers.

## Exercises

### Exercise 00: Bitcoin Exchange

Creates a program that reads historical data and user queries from files, processes the queries using STL containers, and outputs bitcoin values for specified dates.

### Exercise 01: Reverse Polish Notation

Implements an RPN calculator that uses STL stacks to evaluate postfix mathematical expressions and supports basic arithmetic operations.

### Exercise 02: PmergeMe

Develops a complex sorting program that uses the Ford-Johnson algorithm (also known as merge-insertion sort) to sort integers, demonstrating the use of multiple STL containers to optimize performance.

## Usage

Compile the code with:

```bash
make
```

## Conclusion
CPP Module 09 provides a deep insight into the STL's capabilities, using a series of programming challenges that showcase how STL containers, algorithms, and iterators can be used to create efficient and effective solutions to real-world problems.
