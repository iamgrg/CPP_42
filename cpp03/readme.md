# CPP Module 03 - Inheritance in C++

## Project Overview

CPP Module 03 introduces the concept of inheritance, a fundamental aspect of object-oriented programming in C++. This project is part of a series aimed at deepening understanding of C++ through practical examples and exercises that demonstrate the power and flexibility of inheritance.

## Description

This module consists of several exercises that build on each other, starting from basic inheritance scenarios to more complex uses involving multiple inheritance. Each exercise challenges the understanding of how derived classes inherit from base classes and how they can override or extend base class functionalities.

## Key Features

- **ClapTrap Class**: Implements a basic robot with functionalities like attacking, taking damage, and repairing.
- **ScavTrap and FragTrap**: Derived from ClapTrap, these classes introduce special abilities and modify some of the default behaviors.
- **DiamondTrap**: A more complex class that inherits from both ScavTrap and FragTrap, showcasing multiple inheritance and the associated complexities.

## Exercises

### Exercise 00: Aaaaand... OPEN!

Implemented a ClapTrap class with basic functionalities and member functions to simulate actions such as attacking and repairing.

### Exercise 01: Serena, my love!

Introduced ScavTrap, a derived class of ClapTrap, adding unique behaviors and additional functionalities.

### Exercise 02: Repetitive work

Added another derived class, FragTrap, extending ClapTrap's capabilities and altering some properties and behaviors.

### Exercise 03: Now itâ€™s weird!

Explored multiple inheritance by introducing DiamondTrap, which combines features of both ScavTrap and FragTrap.

## Usage

Compile the code with:

```bash
make
```

## Conclusion

CPP Module 03 is designed to provide a clear understanding of how inheritance can be used to create modular and reusable code. The exercises illustrate not only the syntax but also the design considerations when using inheritance in C++.
