# CPP Module 07 - C++ Templates

## Project Overview

CPP Module 07 introduces the concept of C++ templates, a powerful feature for writing flexible and generic code that works with any data type. This module focuses on creating template functions and classes that can operate with various data types, enhancing reusability and reducing code duplication.

## Description

Throughout this module, exercises demonstrate the practical applications of templates, from simple function templates that perform operations like swapping values, to complex class templates that manage dynamic arrays. These exercises illustrate how templates can be used to create versatile and efficient components in C++.

## Key Features

- **Function Templates**: Implements generic functions for operations like swapping values, finding the minimum and maximum, which can work with any comparable data types.
- **Iter Template**: A template function that applies a given function to elements of any array, showcasing the power of templates in iterative operations.
- **Array Template Class**: Develops a robust template class that manages a dynamic array, allowing for safe element access and automatic handling of resource allocation and deallocation.

## Exercises

### Exercise 00: Start with a Few Functions

Introduces basic template functions including `swap`, `min`, and `max`, which are capable of working with any data type that supports comparison and assignment operations.

### Exercise 01: Iter

Expands upon the template concept by creating a function template `iter` that applies a specified function to each element of an array, demonstrating how templates can manage arrays of any type.

### Exercise 02: Array

Designs a template class `Array` that encapsulates a dynamic array, providing features like element access through the subscript operator and size management, while ensuring type safety and proper memory management.

## Usage

Compile the code with:

```bash
make
```

## Conclusion
CPP Module 07 effectively demonstrates the utility and flexibility of C++ templates through a series of practical programming exercises. These templates enable the creation of highly reusable code that can adapt to any data type, enhancing the robustness and maintainability of C++ applications.
