# CPP Module 05 - Exceptions and Repetition in C++

## Project Overview

CPP Module 05 delves into the usage of exceptions and the repetition of code patterns in C++. This module focuses on building robust applications through error handling and explores the bureaucratic processes of paperwork through a metaphorical simulation in C++.

## Description

This module is structured around the theme of bureaucracy, where classes represent different roles within a bureaucratic system, including the creation and handling of forms, and the delegation of tasks through exceptions and class hierarchies.

## Key Features

- **Exception Handling**: Demonstrates the use of C++ exceptions to manage errors gracefully, particularly in scenarios involving bureaucratic procedures.
- **Bureaucrat and Form Classes**: Implements a system where bureaucrats can sign or reject forms based on their grades, with exceptions thrown for invalid operations.
- **Abstract Form Management**: Introduces abstract classes to handle various types of forms, ensuring that each form adheres to specific signing and execution requirements.
- **Intern Class**: Simulates an intern's role in a bureaucracy, capable of generating different types of forms dynamically.

## Exercises

### Exercise 00: Bureaucratic Beginnings

Introduces the `Bureaucrat` class, focusing on exception handling with grade limits.

### Exercise 01: Form Management

Expands the bureaucracy simulation with the `Form` class, which bureaucrats can sign based on their grade levels, demonstrating the use of exceptions in more complex scenarios.

### Exercise 02: Advanced Form Handling

Evolves the form system by implementing different types of forms that perform specific actions, highlighting the use of abstract classes.

### Exercise 03: Automation with Interns

Introduces the `Intern` class, which automates form creation, showcasing dynamic form management based on input strings.

## Usage

Compile the code with:

```bash
make
```

## Conclusion

CPP Module 05 provides a thorough exploration of error handling and class design in C++, using a fun and relatable metaphor of a bureaucratic system. The exercises challenge the developer to think critically about how exceptions can be used to manage errors and how abstract classes can organize complex systems.
