# CPP Module 02

## Project Overview

This project is part of a series exploring advanced features of C++. In `CPP Module 02`, we delve into ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and the Orthodox Canonical class form. These features are critical for creating robust C++ applications that efficiently manage resources and handle operations with user-defined types.

## Features

- **Fixed-point Arithmetic**: Introduction of a fixed-point number class to manage numbers with fixed precision. This is crucial for applications where floating-point precision is insufficient or its overhead is undesirable.
- **Operator Overloading**: Extensive use of operator overloading allows objects of user-defined types to be as intuitive and convenient as built-in types.
- **Orthodox Canonical Form**: Ensuring that every class adheres to a life cycle management protocol, which includes a constructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator, and destructor.

## Key Exercises

### Exercise 00: Fixed Class in Orthodox Canonical Form

Implemented a class representing fixed-point numbers, ensuring all canonical form methods are correctly defined and operational.

### Exercise 01: Enhanced Fixed-point Number Class

Enhanced the fixed-point class to support direct initialization and conversion from/to integer and floating-point numbers, increasing its utility.

### Exercise 02: Expanding Functionality

Introduced a comprehensive set of overloaded operators to facilitate natural arithmetic operations and comparisons between instances of the fixed-point class.

### Exercise 03: Binary Space Partitioning (BSP)

Developed a utility function to determine if a point lies within a given triangle, showcasing the practical application of fixed-point arithmetic in computational geometry.

## How to Use

Compile the code with:

```bash
make
```

## Conclusion

CPP Module 02 is a deep dive into crucial C++ programming concepts that are foundational for developing efficient and powerful C++ applications. Through this project, practical understanding and application of complex features such as operator overloading and memory management are demonstrated.
