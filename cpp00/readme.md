# CPP Module 00 - Introduction to C++

## Overview

CPP Module 00 introduces the basics of C++ including namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and other foundational concepts. This module is designed to transition from C to C++, emphasizing object-oriented programming.

## Objectives

- Understand and apply basic concepts of C++.
- Implement simple C++ programs to familiarize with classes and objects.
- Use standard I/O streams for output.
- Practice memory management without dynamic allocation.

## Exercises

### Exercise 00: Megaphone

- **Description**: Create a program that capitalizes the input it receives and outputs it loudly.
- **Files**: `Makefile`, `megaphone.cpp`

### Exercise 01: My Awesome PhoneBook

- **Description**: Implement a simple phonebook application that can store up to 8 contacts using classes.
- **Files**: `Makefile`, `*.cpp`, `*.hpp`

### Exercise 02: The Job Of Your Dreams

- **Description**: Implement the missing `Account.cpp` based on given `Account.hpp` and log file to simulate a bank account management system.
- **Files**: `Makefile`, `Account.cpp`, `Account.hpp`, `tests.cpp`

## Compilation

Compile the code with:

```bash
make
```

## Usage
Run each program according to the specific instructions provided in each exercise directory. For example, to run the Megaphone:

```bash
./megaphone "Hello, C++!"
```
